allyson_meghan,"@TheCCornerStore @SuchHate @OliLondonTV @MACcosmetics we had womens marches and y’all talked shit about that too. You don’t support women, you’re only mentioning it now bc it fits your transphobic narrative."

allyson_meghan,@PasswordSuck2 @b4s_burner @aurabogado @LiberalsQuiet Are you kidding? It’s petty to vilify someone for saying they’d be turned on by their gf getting raped???????? That’s not just a dumb joke.

allyson_meghan,@myceliummidwife WAIT WAIT mens skinny pants are still 😘🤌🏼
allyson_meghan,whatever this nerdcore ass business casual style is it should’ve been left in 2012 with the mustache trend. You can dress for work without looking like an extra from the Big Bang theory. put the skinny trousers DOWN https://t.co/i2de1T7nrZ
allyson_meghan,AKA grown ass man cherry picks 20 yr olds who aren’t sure of their own opinions as guests bc he knows if he put on a woman who actually knew how to debate he’d get dunked on immediately. these clips are all the same. I want to punch his little rat face
allyson_meghan,@myceliummidwife fr it won’t be enough until every woman’s internal organs are stored in her ass apparently
allyson_meghan,y’all take pics of already beautiful women with amazing bodies and STILL photoshop that shit we are so doomed
allyson_meghan,@mindypatinkin @kidasnow !!!!!!

allyson_meghan,@paulcritchlow @theesilverjew https://t.co/DhnhmdroHJ
allyson_meghan,this man just called my office and he was like “hello allyson” in the scream voice and I was mid-panic when he coughed and said “I’m so sorry I’m from amazon just trying to schedule a delivery and my throat did a weird thing”
allyson_meghan,@theesilverjew why are y’all acting like this is the peak of comedy this is the kinda insult you hear in a middle school cafeteria dude is racist AND he’s bad at it
allyson_meghan,@Tostky @theesilverjew so getting racist after a few drinks is suddenly acceptable? Lmao
allyson_meghan,@britneyqueers_ @cooIboobs she’s beautiful 🥹
allyson_meghan,@Ravinflaminelmo girl you got this!!! Gym anxiety is the worst but in my experience almost everyone there wants to see you succeed and is happy to help💗
allyson_meghan,@chris10holden OKAYYYYY🥵
allyson_meghan,@goseroldmusic Objection your honor https://t.co/HqaqQdBFwU
allyson_meghan,@cooIboobs nothing in this world makes me more enraged than trying to open these fuckers. I’m making mac and cheese for dinner as a grown adult woman I’m obviously not in the mood to conquer an Olympic feat
allyson_meghan,boyfriend reveal 🤪 https://t.co/amgYwmh0P6
allyson_meghan,what is the fucking point (seriously)
allyson_meghan,I love Coachella bc it’s the one time celebrities be messy as hell doing drugs and kissing exes in front of everyone like the rest of us
allyson_meghan,@DATBOYCONROY resentment and conflict avoidance 🫠 People suck at communicating these days
allyson_meghan,I truly have never been enough lmao
allyson_meghan,it turns out when you practice something daily and work hard on it you stop sucking and get better. like in the sims 3!!!! who knew
allyson_meghan,if you have my voodoo doll can you give it a gentle forehead kiss
allyson_meghan,@katyswill @justme2147 @jupitersembrace animals don’t have morals lmfao
allyson_meghan,@aphrobeesiac This!!!! People act like love isn’t subjective. It’s not like you’re committing to marriage it’s just an expression of affection.
allyson_meghan,@goseroldmusic LMFAOOOOO FR my friends pushed me in front of the devil man and I cried
allyson_meghan,I just want everyone to know that i don’t mean to leave my texts and dms unread and it’s not you it is me I just forget or get overwhelmed and I know I have terrible communication skills I am working on it but I love you all kiss kiss🥹
allyson_meghan,@goseroldmusic I lost my virginity at the international balloon fiesta Albuquerque

allyson_meghan,should’ve told y’all I don’t like house or techno 😬😬
allyson_meghan,@myceliummidwife oh shiiii

allyson_meghan,@aphrobeesiac oh shit you have taste
allyson_meghan,@stupid0slut @aphrobeesiac WHAT!!! that’s crazy to me I would go insane if I saw him. When people ask me who’s the one person I’d wanna have dinner with it’s him. He just seems so introspective I feel like he has so much to say about the world and I really love his character in Atlanta
allyson_meghan,@aphrobeesiac Me either!!! I’ve never understood stan culture but he’s that one person for me. He’s just so talented and attractive and smart 🥵

allyson_meghan,@lindawg @Bbqtiddiez Remember me!!!
allyson_meghan,@Bbqtiddiez @lindawg Craziest ending ever bro shit had my jaw DROPPED
allyson_meghan,@merrittk Idk man I had to do this to an ex best friend bc I knew she would never take accountability and when I blocked her she ended up stalking &amp; blackmailing me for months. I don’t owe anyone “closure” if they’ve repeatedly done things to disturb my peace 🤷🏼‍♀️
allyson_meghan,this is literally the intro to American psycho
allyson_meghan,wish I had someone I could ask to go get me things from the store when I’m hungover but no I’m alone this is the worst I might die
allyson_meghan,@lindawg this shit https://t.co/91LQUg2uqT

allyson_meghan,y’all know when you can tell someones lying to you but it’s like lemme see how long they carry this out tbh not even mad just amused that you think I’m this stupid 🥰
allyson_meghan,@sophiaxbaby Nobody ever recognizes the reference when I say it 😭😭😭
allyson_meghan,oh the weather outside is weather
allyson_meghan,if people wanna see you they’ll make it happen so I don’t go out of my way for that shit anymore.
allyson_meghan,this is so damn real bro

ohhhhhkaaay,"Last day of April, I pray and hope May to be better."
ohhhhhkaaay,Somewhere between emotional and emotionless
ohhhhhkaaay,"In term of favoritism, I never win.
When it comes to priority, I know
I'm just their option.
I am always the second or the last, never
been a first choice and never been
someone's favorite."
ohhhhhkaaay,i literally can’t sleep without hugging something
ohhhhhkaaay,https://t.co/XOhaPvBZy7
ohhhhhkaaay,i’m tryna disappear and travel the world with the loml
ohhhhhkaaay,I deserve someone who thinks I'm too important to lose.
ohhhhhkaaay,no more expectations from anyone
ohhhhhkaaay,I don't know what kind of rest should I do to be able to regain myself
ohhhhhkaaay,the best thing i did for myself.. i stopped chasing someone who was okay with losing me
ohhhhhkaaay,maybe he likes you but he never saw you as the girl he’d take the risk for.
ohhhhhkaaay,i played dumb but i always knew
ohhhhhkaaay,nakakapagod na pero may mas pagod pa pala. https://t.co/IXFbd2QVlJ
ohhhhhkaaay,no offense to myself but wtf am i doing
ohhhhhkaaay,"When i feel ignored, I distance myself"
ohhhhhkaaay,the audacity to think i’ll be nice 2 u after being disrespected 🤡🤡
ohhhhhkaaay,hearing “im proud of you” when you're having a hard time hits different
ohhhhhkaaay,maybe u just miss the memories and not the person
ohhhhhkaaay,jealousy can break a whole mood
ohhhhhkaaay,"I don't want to be hurt again so I started to become quiet, I stopped expecting. I'm starting to care less each day."
ohhhhhkaaay,i hope you’re having the best day ever :) u got this
ohhhhhkaaay,i defended ur name when everybody spoke so badly so badly of u
ohhhhhkaaay,"i either talk too much, or i don't talk at all"
ohhhhhkaaay,i hate when i can’t explain the shit i feel
ohhhhhkaaay,"Don’t get mad, get distant."
ohhhhhkaaay,I'm starting to realize that maybe being by myself is actually better than surrounding myself with people who make me feel alone.
ohhhhhkaaay,i’m so lost inside my head
ohhhhhkaaay,i wanna be hugged
ohhhhhkaaay,"You’re already blessed in so many ways, focus on that."
ohhhhhkaaay,sometimes home is a person
ohhhhhkaaay,i want that “damn they still together” type of love
ohhhhhkaaay,"apology accepted, trust gone"
ohhhhhkaaay,i defended ur name when everybody spoke so badly so badly of u
ohhhhhkaaay,my phone will be on dnd but ill still reply in 2 minutes
ohhhhhkaaay,"bruh if she asks abt it, she already knows abt it."
ohhhhhkaaay,i wanna be hugged
ohhhhhkaaay,i be like “yeah its fine” then suffer in silence
ohhhhhkaaay,i don't care *cries*
ohhhhhkaaay,everything is just so heavy rn
ohhhhhkaaay,"be clingy with me, i love that."
ohhhhhkaaay,i lost all my communication skills
ohhhhhkaaay,"feeling unwanted changes you a lot, tbh"
ohhhhhkaaay,"if they want u, they'll make u feel wanted"
ohhhhhkaaay,"bruh if she asks abt it, she already knows abt it."
ohhhhhkaaay,its attractive when someone is crazy about you and isn't afraid to show it
ohhhhhkaaay,i rather lose the chance than take the risk.
ohhhhhkaaay,mentally idk where tf i’m at
ohhhhhkaaay,at least i’m trying
ohhhhhkaaay,normalize unsending messages when it was ignored.
ohhhhhkaaay,a listener needs a listener too
ohhhhhkaaay,"First, know your worth. Second, control your emotions. Third, never settle."
ohhhhhkaaay,I wish I had someone that was excited to talk to me everyday
ohhhhhkaaay,i hope u realize how hard i'm trying
ohhhhhkaaay,"soon, tayo naman yung magkakabahay, magkakaroon ng kotse at magiging financially stable, claim it!"
ohhhhhkaaay,Not sure if I need a hug or get hit by a car.
ohhhhhkaaay,i been treated like a second option by a lot of people i treated as a priority.
ohhhhhkaaay,i think the best memories always remains unphotographed.
ohhhhhkaaay,hugs are so healing
ohhhhhkaaay,I be like “I have to study” then lay down for hours
ohhhhhkaaay,I’m mentally exhausted.
ohhhhhkaaay,i’ll be forever jealous of effortlessly smart people. :(
ohhhhhkaaay,"in my ""eme"" era"
ohhhhhkaaay,i miss you so bad
ohhhhhkaaay,you're the risk i'm willing to take
ohhhhhkaaay,“u okay?” no i wanna die

ohhhhhkaaay,"hi love, i love u. i love u. i love u"
ohhhhhkaaay,im sorry if sometimes im not good enough.
ohhhhhkaaay,"I can’t do anything about it, except to just cry."
ohhhhhkaaay,ohhhhhhhh (i still don’t understand)
ohhhhhkaaay,all of me is tired
ohhhhhkaaay,I hate when i get so much anxiety it’s hard for me to breathe.
ohhhhhkaaay,Lowkey hurt but oh well that’s life
ohhhhhkaaay,treating a girI right is not simping
ohhhhhkaaay,We all a villain in someone’s story
ohhhhhkaaay,I want someone who knows how to handle me when I can’t handle it.
ohhhhhkaaay,i read our chats when i miss you.
ohhhhhkaaay,take a moment to be proud of yourself for surviving the days that felt impossible.
ohhhhhkaaay,yes girl! we're all in our single era rn.
ohhhhhkaaay,i guess i'm stuck forever by the glue oh and you
ohhhhhkaaay,watching someone glow after witnessing their darkest moments makes my heart happy.
ohhhhhkaaay,I never faked my love &amp; care for someone.
ohhhhhkaaay,"there's this gladness that i feel whenever someone enthusiastically tells me about their day, giving me the details, leaving out no special moment in the telling. it's a nice feeling to know that the person doesn't want you to miss something about what they've been up to."
ohhhhhkaaay,"No matter what, I’ll still care."
ohhhhhkaaay,If you see me happy just know I deserve that shit
ohhhhhkaaay,i will never give my all again
ohhhhhkaaay,I miss my favorite person right now.
ohhhhhkaaay,I miss my favorite person right now.

amiraamou,Regret
amiraamou,Semoga diri ini diberi kesihatan untuk menyambut raya esok
amiraamou,Internet start slow doh
amiraamou,Suddenly feel regret for something...
amiraamou,"Kuasa Allah.  Jodoh, maut, perjalanan hidup kita ni Allah dah tulis. Cuma kita aje perlu berusaha, memang sakit, tapi percayalah apa yang Allah tulis untuk kita untuk itulah yang terbaik."
amiraamou,"but that's not the end. I always thought maybe I should change my career to become a teacher... It's just a dream and thought, but then it's happen so suddenly. Alhamdulillah for that, I mean I still cannot believe that it can happen like that."
amiraamou,"From my story, I learnt that in our life everyday is truly mystery... we don't even know what will happen in a second. Everything just took a minute for things to change. Like I never imagine myself to even resign from KKM. I thought I'll just wait until I get permenant position"
amiraamou,Xdok mood lah nyo nok beriftar iftar ramai2 ni... xtahu bakpo sejak dulu lagi... suko beriftar xramai2 🤔
amiraamou,seronok tu seronok... tapi penat
amiraamou,"duduk Klinik keno join group Inovasi dan Kreatif... Mari sini keno ngajar reka bentuk dan teknologi pulok... hahahaha Amira meme x lari dari kreatif dan inovasi bokali. Kreatif lah sangat, x nyesal pulok sero masuk KIK, hari tu sero nyesal 🤭."
amiraamou,"Tiba2 rasa x sia2 masuk KIK... betul lah, setiap benda yang berlaku banyak hikmah tersembunyi"
amiraamou,"Dekat tiktok ada nampak satu quotes tadi, a sky can only be seen from far... not reaching for it. Deep."
amiraamou,"Tomorrow is a new beginning, open a new chapter in my life, meet many new people... that's how life..."
amiraamou,"lepas confess buat xtahu, macam biasa, kalu jumpa gaduh... xfaham sungguh lah... Maybe kawan lagi better kot 🤔

Xpernah terjadi agaknya, lepas confess esok gaduh 😂.

Biarkan macam tu lagi baik kot. 

End of story."
amiraamou,Penat wak sekut rayo 🥴
amiraamou,Pakat duduk wak sekut rayo... sis terpengaruh jugok eh nok wak... 🤭
amiraamou,Ada seseorang mendoakan kita tu dah cukup terharu 😭
amiraamou,Sekurang²nya dia bagi nasihat yang berguna... biarlah kita ingat sebagai last kenangan
amiraamou,Penat pindah randah ni... rasa nak tinggal semua barang kat sini aje
amiraamou,I think I got the answer already... now... it's time to move on
amiraamou,Punya berdebar tahap lain macam
amiraamou,Settle confess... kita fokus benda lain pulak... banyak lagi list nak kena settle
amiraamou,Settle...
amiraamou,"Someone told me before "" In whatever you did... just don't look back anymore... just don't... you've done your best. Things happen for a reason."""
amiraamou,The journey is still long... semoga Allah sentiasa permudahkan jalan ini.
amiraamou,From now on... there's no turning back... no looking back... it is what it is
amiraamou,Tapi... xpo kea... bukea jupo doh pun pah ni kea...🙂
amiraamou,Kalu kito tahu doh jawape... perlu jugok ko?
amiraamou,Nok confess ko x sir ni eh? 😪
amiraamou,If I gone... will you be sad?

TadeuszGiczan,"@aravosis I saw lots of negative reviews before deciding to go there but it went surprisingly smoothly, you can even book tickets online these days (since very recently, I imagine). Pretty cool to walk through the live Rome once you've seen what's left of it https://t.co/ks9cOHtgz1"

TadeuszGiczan,"@blinzka Officially Belarus only ships humanitarian aid to Africa and never weapons and yet somehow it's among the top 20 weapons suppliers globally. One can only guess how so. I wouldn't take this to court, obviously"

TadeuszGiczan,@J_Jaraczewski I must confess: I saw all the previous pictures and wow that was quick
TadeuszGiczan,"@AlexKokcharov @culturaltutor I don't think the post says it's Soviet. The way I see it, it's an illustration of ""old architectural styles rejected by Soviet Constructivism and Futurism"""

TadeuszGiczan,"@KruszynskiJakub Didn't know about it, globalisation at its weirdest!"

TadeuszGiczan,@NiekvdZ Well... you're not incorrect:)
TadeuszGiczan,Thought I'd share with you the latest addition to my little collection of football shirts because this one's really special (and Ukraine-related). Any guesses as to what's hiding behind the rather odd-shaped Schalke 04 patch? The clue is in the date (just blink if you know😉) https://t.co/tCEIMDCaXE

TadeuszGiczan,"Russian news outlet Agentstvo noticed that in one of the videos of Putin's ""today's"" trip to the occupied territories of Ukraine, he said: ""There's Easter coming up, isn't it?"" which was muted in later versions.

TadeuszGiczan,"Food for thought for cultural anthropologists: The Russian (or should I say Soviet?) occupational administration in Melitopol renamed the city streets today.

RadioKate,"@RLyonsAuthor @MichaelRosenYes Ha! I have a small suitcase called Justin with some important documents. It’s my little pun so my loved ones know where to find stuff, just in case ;)"
RadioKate,@ThanksCancer It’s a great super power. Proud of everyone who’s had to face their fears and has responded by laughing (and swearing) and making others laugh. x
RadioKate,"@MarkReckons @brokenbottleboy I always loved walking around the big Paperchase on Tot Court Road with its art section and pen cabinet. There aren’t words to describe my sadness it’s gone, and my rage that it became “Life-size Monopoly” event space."
RadioKate,Good morning! How are you feeling? Enjoyed garden time and sunshine again yesterday - makes such a difference. Might find time to sit out with the crossword today and enjoy it some more. Then I’m going to sprinkle poppy seeds around the trees at top of road. 🌱 #StayBright https://t.co/8R54O3fZ1L
RadioKate,"@brokenbottleboy That’s a badge of honour not an insult though, right? Good stationery is a simple source of joy and should be embraced."
RadioKate,My excuse for being distracted is that I did some gardening and created a vase of flowers for my room. Spring is finally here. :) https://t.co/MlHwEcZ7dT
RadioKate,Good morning! How are you feeling? I forced myself out for that overdue run and I’m back enjoying coffee and the garden. Going to collect up some forget-me-nots and pop them in a little vase. Ooops - apparently got distracted by sun and garden. #StayBright https://t.co/JTuwXqwMJn
RadioKate,@brokenbottleboy Wowser.
RadioKate,"Good morning! How are you feeling? My garden has sprung into life in a somewhat ramshackle manner, but k rather like it’s carpet of forget-me-not and bluebells, interspersed with daffodils and tulips.

RadioKate,"Good morning! How are you feeling? We had a lovely clear sunny day yesterday, but today is torrential rain. Glad I went for my walk to the beach yesterday!

RadioKate,Good morning! How are you feeling? Eid Mubarak if you’re celebrating today. Lack of curtains means I’ve been enjoying sunrise the last few days - it’s quite lovely. Almost the weekend - yay! #StayBright https://t.co/BYH4KSuMup
RadioKate,@mohsin It’s today? Eid Mubarak - have a lovely day!
RadioKate,"@DerkHat Oh dear, sorry Del. Hope you don’t feel room bad and it passes quickly. Was thinking of you as I looked at some shirts in a retro charity shop in Falmouth the other day. Sending ‘get well’ wishes x"
RadioKate,"@TumsMakwela @Gailee99 @ThanksCancer I remember dashing to answer the door to the postie in my pjs, and he looked a bit shocked. ‘Surely you’ve seen people before they got dressed’ I thought, then realised I was holding a drain bottle half filled with blood with the tube coming out of the bottom of my pj top! 😳"
RadioKate,@GilKarout @ThanksCancer @Gailee99 Like when I went for my first scans I was more worried about being naked in front of people than about the potential for it being cancer (even with the feeling it probably might me).
RadioKate,"@Psythor I don’t think the point of the test was for it to blow up, but I get your point. Big difference between SLS ‘test’ flight and Starship test though in terms of expectations of success - so you have to consider context in which “test” is used."
RadioKate,"@Watching_events @Psythor @mjrobbins It wasn’t going to do a full orbit, almost an orbit but not quite. But yes, had it done that, and survived re-entry without breaking up, that would have been pretty incredible. Leaving the launch pad was as much as Elon hoped for."
RadioKate,Good morning! How are you feeling? Getting set for some big space action today (hopefully) there will be a Starship launch later. I found the sea yesterday and spent some time just watching the waves (and running away when they crept up on me). #StayBright https://t.co/RDb4X7O6AL
RadioKate,@Polly_Heck Weather is much better today! 😁🍦🍨
RadioKate,"@Gailee99 @ThanksCancer 💯 Spent my time giggling about lots of crazy things. Like how fast I went from being super shy about being half naked, to getting used to just flashing my boobs to all sorts of (medically trained) strangers!"
RadioKate,@ThanksCancer @Gailee99 I had the big pants too - and pretty sure I also laughed and photographed them!
RadioKate,@ThanksCancer This sort of made me laugh.. the patient loos in the nuclear medicine department - “no entry except authorised persons”. https://t.co/VU7gC35Llk
RadioKate,Useful reminder https://t.co/G4FQVqRrj5
RadioKate,@Polly_Heck An ice-cream crawl? YUM! I like that idea very much - though it was a bit blustery today for ice-cream. And I got chased by the sea!
RadioKate,@richardkendall Yes - I think so! Though maybe I need to leave some of the jobs to be done here so I have my first customer!
RadioKate,"@Toby_Johnson Yes it really is! This is my first time here, helping friend move in, and I like the vibe so much. Let me know if you make it here! :)"
RadioKate,Good morning! How are you feeling? I’ve been out to get DIY and general supplies to make further progress moving friend into new home. Genuinely considering having a Cornish summer as an odd jobs handy-woman! #StayBright https://t.co/S5ZGO7vclK
RadioKate,@DocClaireP Falmouth!
RadioKate,"@DocClaireP Isn’t it just! My first visit and I was amazed to go from Lego, to boogie boards, to guitars in three steps - and it got all the more interesting and unexpected from there on in!"
RadioKate,@japharl Hope you’ve got some antihistamines to soothe the allergies
RadioKate,@rocketman528 Oh lovely! Eat ALL THE TAPAS for me!
RadioKate,Good morning! How are you feeling? I’m enjoying being by the sea and having a break from London. Lots of crafty and arty people here so it’s nice to see what they’ve made. This friendly felt lion caught my eye yesterday! #StayBright https://t.co/m8ECT62vwZ

RadioKate,@Brannigand Falmouth!
RadioKate,"Good morning! How are you feeling? Yesterday was looooong! Sleeper train, interview, #ESAJuice launch, space sloth, unpacking boxes, making a bed, making the bed, eating amazing Indian food, bar in a bookshop, and now sunshine on the terrace. Grand. #StayBright https://t.co/aBLqXJZZ7o"
RadioKate,"@Thievesbook Honestly I would sort of love that, because obviously you’d get to do it again!"

RadioKate,@NickAstronomer Was thinking the same… shame.
RadioKate,"Good morning! How are you feeling? I think it’s fair to say that I am officially tired. Sleeper train was fun, but I was too excited to sleep! Ha. Interview done, maybe time for a nap before ESA Juice launches. #StayBright https://t.co/o0cjbWKvoG"
RadioKate,@kejames It’s a delight! Shame it’s a bit grey now we’re arriving. But I’m still smiling! :)
RadioKate,"Being gently rocked to sleep on the train. Can’t tell whether to embrace the tendrils of much-needed sleep, or stay awake to enjoy the thrill of being tucked up in bed on a train. A bit of the latter while the tendrils take hold I think. Blissful."
RadioKate,@brokenbottleboy No way I could have afforded my cancer treatment over there…
RadioKate,@Brannigand Went with coffee and was pleased to re-meet @Simba_LeMoine :)
RadioKate,"@ThanksCancer @PhoenixDfire That is so special - and so wonderful. Massive hugs. I’m sorry you lost her so young. I was 24 when I lost mum. Thanks cancer 🙄. She always said everything happens for a reason, and so I try to be there for people who lose their mums. It’s the most positive thing I can do.."
RadioKate,"@penfriendrocks Haha - sounds like me and running. Hate it, but it’s good for me.. grr."
RadioKate,"@PhoenixDfire @ThanksCancer So sorry to hear this. Be kind to yourself and allow yourself space and time to grieve. You’re part of ‘special club’ now - worst club, most expensive entry fee, but we look out for each other. Lost my mum in 2004, so I do my best to live for both of us now."
RadioKate,"@im_jdasilva My favourite barista was outside, so I didn't get my special hot choc with espresso magic thing he made me last time. Coffee welcome though. :)"
RadioKate,Hungry and waiting to be stabbity-jabbed. Then Penny Drop time - hot choc or cappuccino today..?
RadioKate,@ArianeSherine Reminds me of an amazing response from a friend after showing messages I got on a dating app (from guy who refused to use capitals): “Fucker be using four dot ellipses FFS”. Made me laugh. Bullet dodged.
RadioKate,"Good morning! How are you feeling? I woke at 3am, again, probably because I was worried about sleeping through my alarm and missing radio interview! Day of jabby needles, so a trip to the Penny Drop in order too. Walked through sunshine with rain last night - rainbow! #StayBright https://t.co/orbJcXCyGl"
RadioKate,"@25deadbatts @brokenbottleboy I find it hard to wake up in the morning, so I find the rage it often induces helpful in shaking off slumber!"
RadioKate,@ctimmermann @frankendodo @Nic_ky___R - I don’t suppose you know?
RadioKate,@brokenbottleboy I’ve always found Thought for the Day much better at getting me moving (away from radio) than any morning alarm.

RadioKate,"Go away insomnia, you are not welcome here."
RadioKate,@YasserM86 Thanks - and Ramadan Kareem :)
RadioKate,@YasserM86 What date do you think Eid will fall on this year?
RadioKate,I mean the first sentence is a good one. I often tell people to use a voice memo app to record their parents or grandparents telling stories of their youth. You’ll have the story and their voice. The rest of this is a Black Mirror nightmare. 😧
RadioKate,"Good morning! How are you feeling? Shame about the rain, but that’s a good excuse to enjoy coffee and crossword inside. Lovely evening out last night with great company and delicious dinner. Always like the lights in Carnaby St. #StayBright https://t.co/0aRQkT6VSL"
RadioKate,@chrisapplegate 😲😲😲
RadioKate,"@keewa @marcusjdl @JournoSchool Yes yes - I am fully aware of this, and it’s a massive issue. I’m just saying that there are a few of us who got there against the odds."
RadioKate,@jaggeree @mrmarksteel @melankkolia @ebtg That’s tough. Sending you good vibes. I found it helped to give stuff away to people on Freecycle where I could. Something about seeing the joy that someone else would get from mum’s things made it easier to let them go.
RadioKate,"@marcusjdl @JournoSchool Well indeed, but that’s another issue, that basically comes back to the first.."
RadioKate,FAO @marcusjdl
RadioKate,"@marcusjdl @JournoSchool I mean yes and no. There is a huge issue around class and diversity in journalism, but not everyone who went to Oxbridge came from privilege."
RadioKate,"@Scotontherock5 @rocketman528 @TonyChocolonely Yes! I understand the idea behind the uneven ‘square’ size, but it doesn’t help me when I think “okay, one little bit more” and I break off a huge chunk!"
RadioKate,"@rocketman528 Fix that, pronto!"
RadioKate,@Scotontherock5 @rocketman528 @TonyChocolonely Ooh that sounds yummy! I just finished a bar of theirs!
RadioKate,@brokenbottleboy @drkatedevlin Just seeing this - hope you’re okay - both of you xx
RadioKate,Run done. Can tuck into chocolate and feel like I’ve earned it. :)
RadioKate,@seis_matters Certainly hope you found chocolate at the end of that!
RadioKate,"@MoAwesomeSauce It’s.. so-so at the mo, but hoping for brighter days as spring is now here x"
RadioKate,@MoAwesomeSauce @beingmusab @ZamanX90 @gazly @arshadnajudeen @ahamednishadh @PolRotiya Hope you’re keeping well! Ramadan Kareem! x
RadioKate,@mrjamesob Either way if that’s the worst she’s ever had to endure then she could do with a stroll in my shoes for a bit.
RadioKate,"@drwilding Oh dear, just about to give it a go… 😬"
RadioKate,Oh FFS
RadioKate,Good morning! How are you feeling? I decorated some eggs a while ago and wondered what to do with them. I’ve hung them in the young cherry trees at the top of the road. Wonder if anyone will notice! (I’ll watch the street WhatsApp with interest 😂) Happy Easter. #StayBright https://t.co/wrVPwFEirc
RadioKate,"@petern06 Well, I am not certain I’ll do it in a large scale, but I might patch up some areas that need urgent attention at least"
RadioKate,@ThanksCancer https://t.co/AkZeVv6cDm
RadioKate,"Good morning! How are you feeling? I am pleased that it hasn’t rained overnight, as I left the washing out and then dreamt there was a downpour! Nice to see the bulb starting to grow and even flower in some cases. #StayBright https://t.co/taNWzeM7u0"
RadioKate,"@CorArdens But I did it, so - yayay!"
RadioKate,@petern06 I need to take out all the concrete stuff between my bricks and replace it with breathable lime. Eek!
RadioKate,@RoddyJenkins DIY and gardening I think!
RadioKate,@CorArdens Thank you! It didn’t feel too bad until the end bit when I was soooooo bbbooorrreeddd!
RadioKate,@RoddyJenkins Thank you!
RadioKate,"Woohoo - did the dreaded run! Really is so boring, but I managed 5k today, huzzah!"
RadioKate,@Kevmacd Would have been a very powerful drone to lift that lot! Wouldn’t be happy with that flying above me!
RadioKate,@alrightPET @noodlemaz Brilliant. Thank you for the chuckle.
RadioKate,"@aliciacurry_ @myldn Yes, you can."
RadioKate,@Sarah_Woolley @MistinguetteCat Oh! Are you okay? x
RadioKate,@MistinguetteCat @Sarah_Woolley Oooh Havana! Enjoy!
RadioKate,Good morning! How are you feeling? I just took delivery of 175kg of lime mortar. Repointing - a new skill to learn. Just watch the ambulance helicopter in action nearby - very much hope whoever it collected is okay. Helicopters are quite awesome. #StayBright https://t.co/xIRsSnnUwb
RadioKate,Just seen ambulance helicopter seemingly looking to find a place to set down near Wood Street. Hope it’s not another stabbing. Hope everyone is safe. Actually seems to be landing near Shernhall street. #Walthamstow @stellacreasy

RadioKate,"@Trinifood @Oprah Cancer-wise hopefully(?), touchwood. Hormone treatment-wise, still trying to find something that has right balance of ‘keep cancer away’ and ‘menopause madness’!"
RadioKate,"Good morning! How are you feeling? I scored a job interview, but looked again at details and they appear to be paying £20k+ below industry average. Glassdoor reviews not sparkling either. Should I do the interview for practice? Disappointed but going to #StayBright https://t.co/yskoH9VUrP"
RadioKate,"@Trinifood @Oprah Mine were anti-cancer meds, which forced a sudden menopause and boy oh boy did that hit me like several tonnes of bricks! Not even allowed HRT. :("
RadioKate,@Trinifood @Oprah Strong agree. My meds put me suddenly and very brutally into a biochemical menopause and I was given no warning of any of what was going to come. I felt like I’d gone crazy.
RadioKate,@_Jessification_ Am I allowed to tag my alter-ego @SpaceKate? ;)
RadioKate,"@Scotontherock5 Here if you need to talk, or just want pictures of kittens and penguins. :)"
RadioKate,@PaulGuinnessy Argh.
RadioKate,"@porkerandpodge Ooh - yeah you could go to the visitor centre, take a look in advance in case they have any interesting tours you can book on. Oh and be sure to visit Anomaly Brewing in Houston - set up by ex-NASA folk!"
RadioKate,"Good morning! How are you feeling? It’s run day today so I have to psyche myself up for that. I still feel chilly, to my bones, so that’s not helping! Finished off another furniture rescue project yesterday, huzzah! #StayBright https://t.co/P0q6tR9uxK"
RadioKate,@katebevan He did what?!
RadioKate,@WamwariW 100%
RadioKate,"The irony of seeing this a week after the final broadcast of @DigitalPlanet. @bbcworldservice - it’s not too late to correct this, is it?"
RadioKate,"@gav Well if you need a hand, let me know. Happy to jump in and the deep end :)"
RadioKate,@Thievesbook It is indeed!
RadioKate,"Good morning! How are you feeling? Had a chat in BBC Scotland about the bankruptcy of Virgin Orbit then some coffee. Possibly should have done that the other way round, heh. Chilly but with sunshine! Hello sunshine! :) #StayBright https://t.co/Iec7HbpPYC"
RadioKate,@Joi_the_Artist Yay for chocolate at least x
RadioKate,"@christapeterso During my undergrad lab project I had other hobbies and my lab supervisor made my life hell because of them, so I left science."
RadioKate,"Good morning! How are you feeling? The sunshine is shining through the window, but it was freezing when I woke up! Nice to catch up and eat toasties with @Brannigand yesterday. In honour of our trip, here’s some friendly cheese! #StayBright https://t.co/z78rapqWtC"
RadioKate,@dansumption Yep! This. Though I did start wearing my big headphones in an open plan office after a number of times where I was seemingly ignoring people talking to me while listening to classical music on headphones they couldn’t see - and jumping out my skin when I was tapped on shoulder!
RadioKate,@Pandamoanimum @katebevan Haha - literally just tweeted from my @spacekate account to be clear I do not pay for mine!
RadioKate,@HeatherDoranDr And back gardens! :)
RadioKate,"@DerkHat Cut-throat razor and relaxing don’t feel like they belong in same sentence, but I’ve heard others rave about this too!"

RadioKate,"@drkatedevlin What?! That sucks. Sorry to hear about the landlord, and the delays, glad there is gin."
RadioKate,@BBCSteveR @bbclysedoucet I often wonder how you’re doing. When I hear your reports and think about the situation you’re in I wonder how you’re feeling about it all and how hard it must be for you. I do hope you’re okay.
RadioKate,@KeithMansfield @chrisapplegate Haha - that’s the local comp!
RadioKate,@KeithMansfield @chrisapplegate Oh! Think that’s the posh school up by the forest (which makes sense given the name!)
RadioKate,Good morning! How are you feeling? Great to see @KeithMansfield for some BFI film fun (though not the cheeriest of films!) and catch up with @chrisapplegate too. Glad to see the skateboarders still enjoying the Southbank. Happy weekend! #StayBright https://t.co/a29JTcxblV

AshleyRTrawick,@just_juanie I'm so sorry.
AshleyRTrawick,"There's so much happening, and it JUST hit noon."

AshleyRTrawick,@MindaHarts OMG I want this!!
