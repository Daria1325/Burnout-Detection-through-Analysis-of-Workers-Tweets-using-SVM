        <h2>How to analize the chart</h2>
        <p class="fs-5">To begin with, you need to refer to the grouped list. People who are in the high-risk zone must be examined in more detail,
           as well as people whose condition has worsened. For more detailed research, you need to go to the employee's personal page. 
           There you can see graphs based on indicators, which will help to ascertain the state of the employee.</p>
        <h2>What to do with people in risk</h2>
        <p class="fs-5">If a person is at risk, first you need to talk to the employee's manager and 
          ask if he has noticed any changes in his work or communication with the employee. 
          If the changes were in a negative direction, it is necessary to contact the employee himself and inquire about his condition, 
          indicate that the company provides the services of a psychologist free of charge and offer to take a course.</p>
